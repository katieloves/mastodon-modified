# Mastodon Modified

**Mastodon Modified** is an experimental fork of [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon) that explores additional features, interface changes, and behavior inspired by other Fediverse software such as **Sharkey** and **Misskey**.

This project is maintained as a **small-scale learning and experimentation effort**. It is not intended to replace upstream Mastodon or act as a drop-in production alternative.

Mastodon Modified exists to:

* Experiment with new or alternative ideas for Mastodon
* Explore feature concepts found in other Fediverse platforms
* Learn how Mastodon’s codebase works internally
* Test small modifications that may not fit upstream design goals

The project prioritizes learning, experimentation, and personal development over stability or long-term support.
